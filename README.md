# iLite MySql JavaFx Sales System
# Attention!
Im publishing this old project cuz few guys where asking me on youtube. There are many bugs and  I also lost the sql file, but if you are smart you can create it by 
analyzing the code in the package "com.inv.xflux.entity", and the project is not completed, many features are missing, so feel free to code some.

# Building
Just open the project with Intellij and use "gradlew.bat jpackage -PinstallerType=msi" to create Window executable.
Note: You must have the wix toolset installed and jdk14+ installed and added to the Path.

For mac just use "./gradlew jpackage -PinstallerType=pkg"

For linux use "./gradlew jpackage -PinstallerType=deb" or rpm

# FINAL NOTE
I will not be fixing or updating this project, so use it as your own discretion.
